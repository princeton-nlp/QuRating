Compare two text excerpts and choose the text which requires greater expertise and prerequisite knowledge to understand it.

Aspects that should NOT influence your judgement:
1. Which language the text is written in
2. The length of the text
3. The order in which the texts are presented

Note that the texts are cut off, so you have to infer their contexts.
The texts might have similar quality, but you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text.

[Option {label_a}]
... {text_a} ...


[Option {label_b}]
... {text_b} ...


Now you have to choose between either {label_a} or {label_b}. Respond only with a single word.
